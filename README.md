# flutter-call-java-example
Calling Java code (on Android) from Dart code in Flutter

## How to run the app?

- Install Android SDK and Flutter.
- Clone the repository.
- Run the Flutter app with `flutter run`

## How to call Objective-C on iOS
Implement a method channel listener in the iOS host app (refer [this guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/platform-channels?tab=type-mappings-kotlin-tab#step-4-add-an-ios-platform-specific-implementation)) similar to the Android version. Then, this Flutter app will work as expected on iOS too.
